				<h2>Ideas. Strategy. Expertise.</h2>
				
				<p>While for-profit and not-for-profit often have different objectives all ventures require self-analysis and strategic thinking. All ventures need to communicate internally and externally and in my experience, successful ventures cultivate a positive culture rooted within a set of core values and a shared vision amongst stakeholders.</p>




				<p>There is always something needed. Expand. Contract. Pivot.</p>
				
				<p><em>What do you need?</em>
				
				<ul>
					<li>more customers / followers / subscribers / patrons / programming</li>
					<li>more brand reach and awareness</li>
					<li>more revenue</li>
					<li>effective/improved communication to your core audience / customer / community</li>
					<li>raise funds/development</li>
					<li>fix something that isn’t working</li>
					<li>expand something that is working</li>
					<li>add something that is missing</li>
					<li>fresh look to improve organization and building a team</li>
					<li>new partnerships or business development</li>
					<li>assessing strengths and weaknesses internally and externally</li>
					<li>exploring opportunities to grow</li>
					<li>develop or improve business plan and/or strategic plan</li>
				</ul>
				
				</p>
				
				<p><em>What I Provide.</em></p>
				<p>I quickly learn who you are and where you are and what your needs are at this time, and then I engage.</p>
				<p>I offer my ideas, perspective, analysis and expertise - the process is collaborative. The output of our process can lead to a set of recommendations or the creation of a formal strategic plan. A variety of tangible actions or materials can result. (e.g. new presentations for board, new marketing campaign, etc.)</p>
				<p>My involvement and level of participation is entirely up to your needs. I can be a catalyst or see something through to full execution with you.</p>
				

				<h2 class="expander-title">Value Proposition <span></span></h2>

					<p><em>Experience:</em> I have been a serial entrepreneur, a CEO and Director of a technology start-up, a Board Chair for a presenting-arts non-profit, and president of a small foundation. I founded R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> originally as a boutique digital agency providing ideas and implementations. As a consultant I have worked closely with small businesses, start-ups and non-profits with varying missions and visions.</p><p>I have directed and managed most facets of smaller organizations and their projects, missions and deadlines. I understand how it all works together and what it takes to get things done and on deadline.</p><p>Whether negotiating a license deal, expanding sales and distribution, finding a new sponsor or working with academics, city agencies and creatives on a new program, I have a lot of depth and range and quickly come up-to-speed.</p>
					
					<p><em>Key Areas of Expertise:</em>

							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>Mixman is an interactive music technology company with products for consumers and music-hobbyists. In the marketplace since 1996, Mixman has made: desktop software, hardware with partner Mattel, and brokered major artist label content for use with all its products. Mixman had its own section on MTV for two years for “Remixing.” Mixman has been bundled with major tech partners like Intel and SONY, and has done myriad licensing deals. Mixman has also been involved in brand partnerships and marketing tours with Yahoo, Pepsi-Frito-Lay, Hershey’s and M&amp;M Mars among others.</p>
								
							<p>Mixman has innovated online and with Apps, launching social-networking and self-publishing in the late 90&rsquo;s and early 00&rsquo;s long before the term &ldquo;social networking&rdquo; even existed.</p>
							
							<h4>Role</h4>
							<p>I was Mixman&rsquo;s CEO for 12+ years after I and my partners engineered a buy-back in 2002. After a dot.com merger in ‘99 I was Mixman GM and VP of Creative for Beatnik Inc. (the parent company). I was Director of Product Development when I started with Mixman in early 1997.</p>
								
							<p>Under my leadership, Mixman activities included: patents and trademarks, website development and launches, branding, packaging, ad-campaigns, social-marketing, event-marketing, retail sales, licensing, localization, 100’s of software releases and a great deal more.</p>
							
							<p>I have been involved with all aspects of Mixman, from high-level strategy to innovation to implementation. Whether negotiating licensing deals or supervising a new product line, I brought my leadership and vast experience to bear. I bring that know-how, as well as the practical experience of being in a start-up environment, to every new business challenge and opportunity.</p>

							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>Urban Cowgirl is a lifestyle brand for women with a focus on color cosmetics and beauty. It had a flagship location in Silicon Valley, and wanted to achieve distribution with high end retailers in NYC, Los Angeles and the Bay Area. Press tours in NYC and trunk tours in Atlanta, Dallas and elsewhere proved very promising. Henri Bendel and others showed interest but help was needed closing. R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> was brought in to help expand and re-imagine the brand and to develop new business strategies as well as look for licensing opportunities.</p>
							
							<h4>Role</h4>
							<p>R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> worked closely with Urban Cowgirl&rsquo;s founder to create new business and marketing initiatives, providing creative ideation, strategic planning and tactical implementation. An affiliate program was created for young women known as the “Posse-Girls.” A social strategy was put in place for a section of the website titled the “Giddi-Up Lounge,” and a variety of other programs were developed, including a first person series “A Day in the Life of the Urban Cowgirl…”</p>

							<p>I helped the founder form a board that included an ex-VP of Marketing/CFO of Avon, and turned Urban Cowgirl in to a C-Corp. I assisted with negotiations with a factory in China that manufactured cosmetics and was looking for US partnerships.</p>
							
							<p>R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> reworked a home-spun website and developed a comprehensive CMS solution with e-commerce that provided both scalability and flexibility. SEO as well as FB and Twitter strategies were put in place. New product lines were developed including &ldquo;5 Minutes to Gorgeous,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Belle d’ Henri,&rdquo; and a line of fragrances.

							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>ONCEKids/Fujimini Adventure Series are the brands for a children&rsquo;s book author and blogger/personality who writes for parents. The books emphasize pan-Asian cultural themes. Several e-books and print books were in the marketplace, and a crude website was in place when R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> was brought in to develop the brands more fully and create new designs and web assets. The client required Biz-Dev and Marketing strategies as well as assistance with implementation for the duration of the project.</p>
							
							<h4>Role</h4>
							<p>I worked closely with the founder and author to re-imagine her vision for her business and brands. I unpacked the awkwardness of trying to have one brand serve the parent audience and provide information and materials for librarians and classroom teachers and another brand that was targeted to children ages 4 to11. I helped reveal that not only were two brands needed, but that the Fujimini brand – with a series of books based on animal creatures – was analogous to Sesame Street, where the location was the constant.</p>
								
							<p>For the duration of the project I provided most of the marketing direction and a variety of consulting and implementation services including a full visual catalyst branding effort for both brands; full design of logos, colors and visual language; design and layout for the site; and print collateral – as well as a CMS web solution that could be administered on an ongoing basis by internal teams.

								<h4>Overview</h4>
								<p>BuildingSkills4Work&trade; is an initiative that R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> spearheaded in collaboration with the Center for Literacy Studies at the University of Tennessee and the Center for Women and Work housed at Rutgers University. The initiative provided free online work-skill training for soft and hard skills for low literacy adults, prison re-entry population, and out-of-school youth. </p>
									
								<p>R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> developed a white paper that reviewed the landscape and made recommendations for a web-based skills development initiative. This led to a grant from the State of New Jersey to develop a prototype and, ultimately, to a large grant from the Nicholson Foundation to create BS4W. </p>
								
								<p>In BS4W we wanted to achieve a low-friction access web-based environment that could house interactive learning modules, job search resources and front-end portal to existing resources, and a social forum for collaborative support and to encourage cohort learning. </p>
								
								<p>We determined that the lesson modules needed to depict people in simulated real world job environments via dialog and work-scenarios, and that the lessons needed to be interactive with a high level of engagement.</p>
								
								<p>The Center for Literacy Studies provided the raw script and curricular materials while R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> adapted those materials to create a usable format, provide a good learner experience, and create a visual and stylistic consistency utilizing good user experience models. 
								</p>

								<h4>Role</h4>
								<p>My role was multi-faceted. Having done the original research, I developed a strong sense of what was missing from available web-based skill development programs and what was needed for the target population. I determined that adult learners had specific challenges and needed to not feel this was merely remedial. We had to provide a quality audio-visual experience. We employed some novel approaches with photography, voice-over, vector design and Flash programming to develop the actual modules. We also developed a LAMPS solution for user-accounts and progress tracking. The website was built to be scalable and to allow us to add the other components over time.</p>
									
								<p>I worked closely with CWW, CLS, and the funder. I led focus group testing in Newark, NJ and Oklahoma City as well as in the Bay Area. The creative, brand, design and coding were done under my supervision and executed by my teams. I presented the project scope and goals at a national conference in Washington D.C. and later at a conference on work issues in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>
								
								<p>A small marketing campaign was also spearheaded by R&amp;D<sup>2</sup>, and we created print collateral for learners and educators. Plans for expanding BS4W were stymied by the economic collapse in 2008 as funding for our target population dried up.
								</p>

							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>Not Just a Number was a social-justice initiative addressing the Homicide Epidemic in inner cities. The first city was Oakland California. The project was developed by 49<sup>th</sup> Parallel Productions – new media journalists and rich-media story tellers. R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> collaborated closely and provided consultant services.</p>
								
							<p>The project focused on the humanity of victims of homicide. NJN as a project engaged with the families and community and allowed people to share their stories. An interactive rich-media website was developed that provided key statistics and information on the topic of homicide in the inner city.</p>
							
							<p>An Interactive Map was implemented to indicate the location of each homicide with its date and a non-police photo of the victim. Each photo is a prompt to learn more about the victim and leads to audio or video of the family member sharing their story and remembrances.</p>
							
							<p>The initiative was designed to be a template both in terms of branding and as a technology platform that could expand from city to city. The idea was to train community members to take ownership of the content.
							</p>
							
							<h4>Role</h4>
							<p>49<sup>th</sup> Parallel are experienced video, photo-journalism and documentary creatives. R&amp;D<sup>2</sup> worked closely with 49<sup>th</sup>, consulting on the unfolding vision and implementation including the interactive website. I was also tasked with exploring funding opportunities and acquiring a fiscal sponsor as well as helping to create materials used for dissemination and to generate interest in the project locally and elsewhere in the country. I initiated proposals with contacts in Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey.</p>
