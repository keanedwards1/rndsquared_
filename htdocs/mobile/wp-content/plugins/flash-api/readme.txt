This plugin serves as a faux web service that outputs data from the WP Database to a Flash application in any way you wish.


== Description ==

This plugin serves as a faux web service that outputs data from the WP Database to a Flash application in the format of XML, JSON, TEXT or any other way you wish. It is intended to make managing data for Flash projects easier by leveraging WordPress's awesome admin and data management.
<br>
This plugin insures that the connecting party is a valid user of the API before outputing any data or executing a function. 
<br><br>
<i>* Note: PHP and WordPress knowledge is required to create your own functions and data outputs.</i>


== Installation ==

1. Upload `flash_api` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click Flash API from the `Admin -> Settings` Menu.
4. Set the Application key (this is generated by default but it is wise to change this). 
5. Set the Codex Category (this is set by default but if you wish to name your codex entries something else, do so here). 
6. Open the `/wp-content/plugins/flash_api/services.php` file and begin extending the plugin with your own functions. This is done just like editing the `functions.php` of a theme. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this with my flash app? =

See the flash example: `/wp-content/plugins/flash_api/flash_example/flash_api_example.fla`

= Can I set API keys for individual Users? =

Yes!<br />
1. Edit the user's `profile -> Flash API -> API Key value`. <br />
2. Give that apiKey to the user to use for their flash apps.<br />

You can then alter your services to work only for specific API keys.<br />
You can also set user permissions within your services via Wordpress's user levels manangement (see http://codex.wordpress.org/User_Levels).
